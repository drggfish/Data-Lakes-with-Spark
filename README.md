## Data Lakes with Spark

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset.
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRAACCG128F92E8A55.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAACER128F4290F96.json
```

Here is an example of the contents of a single song file, TRAACCG128F92E8A55.json:
```
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "AR5KOSW1187FB35FF4",
    "artist_latitude": 49.80388,
    "artist_longitude": 15.47491,
    "artist_location": "Dubai UAE",
    "artist_name": "Elena",
    "song_id": "SOZCTXZ12AB0182364",
    "title": "Setanta matins",
    "duration": 269.58322,
    "year": 0
}
```

## Log dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-02-events.json
```

Here is an example of the contents of a single log file, 2018-11-01-events.json:
```
{
	"artist": null,
	"auth": "Logged In",
	"firstName": "Walter",
	"gender": "M",
	"itemInSession": 0,
	"lastName": "Frye",
	"length": null,
	"level": "free",
	"location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA",
	"method": "GET",
	"page": "Home",
	"registration": 1540919166796.0,
	"sessionId": 38,
	"song": null,
	"status": 200,
	"ts": 1541105830796,
	"userAgent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.143 Safari/537.36\"",

}
```

user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
